•	Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The zoo project provided a solution to allow users to present a menu, load data, add data, display data, delete and save to a file.  It made use of vectors and pointers. 
•	What did you do particularly well?
I was able to employ vectors and pointers for the first time in an application.  This worked well as a solution.
•	Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? The solution did not incorporate a way to read in data from a previously saved file after rebooting the program. Incorporating this aspect would eliminate the need to use the Java code after initializing the system for the first time.  In this case the Java code was used more as a software tool to initialize the initial C++ RFID data base, there was no subsequent use of this Java component.  Dropping this Java code component out after initializing the C++ vector in a software development environment would leave the system more secure.  
•	Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
Learning how to manage C++ vectors with pointers was my most challenging task.  I used online resources and a C++ reference book to learn about how to employ vectors with pointers.  I added a C++ reference book for support.
•	What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work? Since this was my first C++ class all aspects of this project are transferable to other projects and coursework.
•	How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?  By ensuring the addition of comments, and whitespace, made the code more readable and maintainable.  Code was made more adaptable by adhering to object-oriented design.
